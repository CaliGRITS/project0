> _Students should have a chance to understand how they're doing in the course and get valuable feedback on the work they've completed from trusted mentors like us._

Our goal is to provide meaningful suggestions and personal guidance to all of our students. While there will undoubtedly be nuances in terms of how we each evaluate student portfolio projects, following these guidelines will ensure that students get the personalized, constructive feedback they deserve.

## Guiding Principles

- Prompts and rubrics are provided to **structure feedback for student projects**.
- Rubrics are based on a **simple, three-point scale**, tailored for each project.
- Metrics for "meets expectations" are clearly defined to help you provide **targeted feedback.**

## Feedback Rules

- Students should be shown a copy of the blank rubric when they are given the initial project prompt.
- Rubric categories and evaluation metrics should always be tied to project specifications.

- Project categories are based on the course standards.
- Instructors should work with their TAs to provide targeted feedback for **every** student.
- Students should receive feedback on their projects **within 2 - 4 days** after submission!

## Rubric Assessment Process

1. Make a copy of the relevant project rubric.
2. Score project requirements using rubric criteria.
  - _Note: Half-points (1.5) are okay but, beyond that, detailed percentages are unnecessary._
3. Enter any notes for specific project deliverables.
4. Enter any notes for the overall student progress report, if applicable.

### Feedback Tips

- Provide precise praise.
- Identify an action step for improvement.
- Give context as to why the action step is important.
- End with a targeted question related to the action step that tests whether or not the student understands the feedback.
  - **Good Example**: "Great work! Your code is well organized. Good use of breaking tasks into separate functions. I see that in your app.js file you used the variable name x on line 84. Consider using more descriptive variable names. As a code reviewer, this would jump out at me. I want to know what every variable contains just by looking at the variable name itself. I do see some other descriptive variables, though! If we were to refactor this code, what would you want to rename x on line 84?"
  - **Poor Example**: "Great Work! You're doing a good job with all of this. Do you have any questions about anything?"

## In-Person Assessment Process

Instructors and IAs are encouraged to meet with students during office hours or one-on-one to review project feedback and discuss growth opportunities. Students should ideally have up to 30 minutes to review their project evaluations or do a code review with instructors and IAs during the week after project submission.

### Model/Code Review Tips

Code review is not troubleshooting time. Instead, the goal is to go through the code and talk about actionable feedback for enhancing the student's project in the future.

- __Student (10 min)__: Have the student walk through and defend his or her project/model/code.

- __Student (10 min)__: Have the student answer the following questions:
  - What do you like most about your project?
  - What would you change if you started from scratch?
  - What would you like to add when you have more time?

- __Instructor/IA (10 min)__: Talk through the evaluation and share a "glow and grow."
  - Make it personal â€” what about the project was exciting or intriguing?
  - Share any highlights and positive areas ("glow") where the student went "above and beyond" the requirements.
  - Share growth areas around time management, workflow, or project approach.
  - Share growth areas around technical skills and ways to remediate any difficulties the student encountered.
  - Help the student prioritize and identify which growth area is most important to focus on before the next project. 
  - Set one or two specific goals for the next project. 
  - If you're reviewing the second or third project with students, ask them how they did against the goals they set previously.

- Finally, be sure to report a summary of your evaluations back to your team so we can evaluate how the class is doing as a whole!
