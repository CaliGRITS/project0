# WDI: Homework

Throughout Unit 1 are dedicated nightly homework assignments. **Weeknight homework** is an opportunity for students to practice the skills they learned in class that day. These assignments are designed to take between 45 minutes and an hour to complete. **Weekend homework assignments**, or weekly projects, start "putting it all together" and will take 2-4 hours to complete. In some cases, weekly assignments will build upon each other so that you work on one deliverable, progressively adding additional layers of complexity and functionality.

Each assignment ties into the learning objectives and standards covered in the day's lessons. Each assignment outlines:
  - Technical Requirements  
  - Deliverables
  - Bonus Challenges
  - Starter Code
  - Additional Resources


## Homework Completion

In order to pass this course, General Assembly students **must**:

- Complete and submit 80% of all course homework assignments.
- Complete and submit the final project, including all five milestones.
- Adhere to [GA's Student Code of Conduct](../../resources/syllabus/student-code-of-conduct.md).

## Homework Best Practices

- **Do your homework!** This course's homework is not meant to be busywork. Practice is an important part of learning any new skill, and your assignments are designed to help you apply new concepts. Being diligent with your homework is critical to your success in WDI.
- **Keep track of questions!** As you go through a homework assignment, make note of any and all areas you are struggling with, can't explain, or have questions about. You can reference your list when we review the assignment in class, or when you have time with an instructional team member.
