    <h2>Lisa Sievers</h2>
    <p>
      A current student in Full Stack Development at GA Assembly in San Francisco. I worked in the SW Industry when Microsoft was in Santa Clara! Don't let that frighten you...;)   I am a high energy, multi-tasker, creative and critical thinker.  I am self-motivated, can work independently, or be a team player!  I like the new collaboration style in business today and am complimented often on the experience that I share with those younger.

    <br>
      <bold>Skills: HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop.  Business ownership, management, team building. <bold>

      <h2>What motivates me? </h2>
      <p>Working on things that make a difference in this world. Yes, money is important, but not the most important to me.  I am old enough to be established in my life with home and family. Would like to contribute, and learn, and grow! I do strive daily to be the change I wish to see! <br>I &hearts; to do all that I can to help the homeless in the Tenderloin, and SF.
      <br>At this age I look for work that is engaging, creative, builds, growing, and making this world a better place! I'm open to talk about any opportunities!
