# WDI: Homeworks

In Unit 1, there is a dedicated homework assignment for each night. **Weeknight homeworks** are an opportunity for students to practice the skills they learned in class that day. These are designed to take between 45 minutes to one hour to complete. **Weekend homework**, or weekly projects, start "putting it all together" and will take between two and four hours to complete. In some cases, weekly homeworks will build upon each other, so that you are working on the same deliverable while adding additional layers of complexity and functionality.

Each assignment ties into the learning objectives and standards that were covered that day. Each assignment outlines:
  - Technical Requirements  
  - Deliverable
  - Bonus Challenges
  - Starter Code
  - Additional Resources


## Homework Completion

In order to pass this course, General Assembly students **must**:

- Complete and submit 80% of all course homework assignments.
- Complete and submit the final project, including all five milestones.
- Adhere to [GA's Student Code of Conduct](../../resources/syllabus/student-code-of-conduct.md).

## Homework Best Practices

- **Do Your Homework!** Homework is not meant as busywork. Practice is an important part of learning any new skill, and your homework assignments are designed to help you apply new concepts. Being diligent about doing your homework is an important step toward success in WDI.
- **Keep Track of Questions** As you go through a homework assignment, make note of all the areas you are struggling with, can't explain, or have questions about. You can reference your list when you review in class, or when you have time with an instructional team member.
